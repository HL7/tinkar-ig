# Welcome to the Tinkar Implementation Guide Repository

This branch is the active branch for applying issues and trackers for the Continuous Integration (CI) Build for the Tinkar Implementation Guide. All issues should be logged using the official [Jira tracker system](http://hl7.org/fhir-issues) so they can be reviewed and voted upon by the HL7 Terminology Infrastructure Work Group. See the Directory of published versions for a list of Tinkar versions and change log.
