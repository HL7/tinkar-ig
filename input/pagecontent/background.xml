  <p>Over the past decades, biomedical terminologies have increasingly been recognized as key resources for knowledge
management, data integration, and decision support [1]. Acceleration and development of Electronic Health Record
(EHR) systems has precipitated the emergence of “standard terminologies” and their widespread adoption in the
clinical community. These include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the
Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. The availability of these clinical
terminologies through the terminology services of FHIR is facilitating their usage in support of interoperability in
healthcare.</p>
<p>
Interoperability requires standardized semantics based on reference terminology provided by standards development
organizations, professional organizations, or government agencies. These organizations publish their content with the
intention of licensing it to health IT vendors, providers, and research organizations. In the U.S., the core clinical
reference terminology is based on SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm. Healthcare organizations must adopt and
integrate subsets or modules of various reference terminology and manage references, dependencies, versions, and
releases. It is important for the integrity of medical records that the change history of concepts and value sets can be
managed and tracked to allow the exchange of either current or retrospective medical records. Therefore, enterprise
terminology requires integrated terminology using a common representation and management.</p>
<p>
Despite the need to use standard terminologies in a highly integrated way, there is no standard representation across
SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm, etc. Some partnerships have been created among development teams to facilitate
interoperability and minimize duplication of effort. Further integration has been proposed but will require additional
resources to bring these terminologies closer together. However, while this evolution leads to greater compatibility
and interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm is non-trivial as these terminologies use
different formalisms and tools for their representation. Various terminologies have different semantics, models, release
cycles, and versioning mechanisms <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>. While there is recognition that terminologies are not standardized at the
exchange level, there is no consensus about harmonized next steps to solve the challenges.</p>
<p>
This document focuses on the need for – and logical specification of – a Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar).
The Tinkar Reference Model is a logical model that describes the standardized model for terminology and change
management. Tinkar provides an architecture that delivers integrated terminology to the enterprise and its information
systems. In doing so, it addresses the differences in management and structure across reference terminology, local
concepts, and code lists/value sets.</p>
<p>
Tinkar aims to adhere to the following statement from a publication about developments in clinical terminologies in the 
2018 Yearbook of Medical Informatics <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>: “The benefits of the integrated terminologies in terms of homogenous semantics 
and inherent interoperability should, however, outweigh the complexity added to the system.” This specification provides 
the foundation of a knowledge architecture that is intended to integrate reference terminology from distributors 
(e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm) with local concepts to support interoperable information semantics across the enterprise.</p>

<h3>Motivation: Why Tinkar? </h3>
<p>
Information systems that are used across the healthcare enterprise record and manage clinical data using clinical
statements and clinical terminologies in non-standardized ways. Interoperability specifications aim to require
terminology bindings to concepts, code systems, and reusable value sets. Currently, there is variation in clinical
data exchange across the enterprise, as existing payloads and clinical statements use inconsistent and highly variable
enterprise terminologies. The management of the concepts, code systems, and value sets is non-trivial because
developers, implementers, and end users are forced to manage “unnecessary complexity.” For example:
</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
        Representation of medications: RxNorm codes overlap with CVX codes. Investigational vaccines from the FDA
are not represented in RxNorm, CVX, or SNOMED CT®.
      </li>
      <li>
        Representation of COVID-19 result codes are inconsistent and are not equivalent (e.g., detected, undetected,
positive, negative, etc.).
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
As a result of these complexities, there are many ways to say the same thing using standard terminologies and standard
formats. The Institute of Medicine report, Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care,
highlighted the unintended consequences of health IT-induced harm that can result in serious injury and death due
to dosing errors, failure to detect serious illnesses, and delayed treatment due to poor human-computer interactions,
confusing clinical terminology, or unreliable data quality <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a>. Despite the widespread understanding of the importance
of the quality of clinical data, there is currently a lack of integration and management of clinical terminologies across
the healthcare enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
Tinkar intends to support integration of clinical terminology and local concepts to support increased data quality
for interoperable clinical information. High-quality clinical data enables healthcare systems across the enterprise to
conduct robust and meaningful data analysis and increase overall interoperability, which ultimately enhances quality
of care across all medical facilities.

  <h3>The Problem Tinkar Addresses</h3>
  <p>
  The following four high level potential deficiencies related to poorly integrated terminology and inefficient change
management describe preventable harm that Tinkar addresses:
  </p>
  <ol>
  	<li>
  		<b>Inability to recognize equivalence.</b>
  		<ul>
  		Difficulty with determining that codes/terms using standard terminologies from disparate health IT systems
represent a common clinical idea/concept (e.g., “Feels Feverish” in the Temperature Symptoms SNOMED CT®
hierarchy versus “Feels Hot/Feverish” in the Observation and Sensation SNOMED CT® hierarchy. Both concepts
are Findings in SNOMED CT® but there is no unifying way to identify equivalence).
  		</ul>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<b>Inability to represent a pertinent phenomenon.</b>
  		<ul>
  		A new set of local terminology may be managed with value sets and concept gaps addressed in quick iterations
(e.g., “COVID-19 negative test result” was needed in practical use before official SDO releases, or gaps like
“mild anemia”, which was proposed, but not accepted, by both the international and U.S. SNOMED CT® release).
  		</ul>
  	</li>
   	<li>
  		<b>Flawed information.</b>
  		<ul>
  		Incorrect usage or representation of clinical ideas/concepts from standard terminologies due to a lack of
harmonization and multiple representations that currently exist (e.g., LOINC® and SNOMED CT® have
overlapping concepts).
  		</ul>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<b>Inability to reliably and safely evolve over time <a href="#footnote3">[3]</a></b>
  		<ul>
  		There is a lack of clear, detailed descriptions of changes to terminologies over time so that changes can be
understood by implementers. Terminologies often change in ways that are convenient for the creators, but
complex for the users (e.g., redundancy, major name changes, code reuse, and changed codes).
  		</ul>
  	</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  	<b>Consider the following examples of implementations that have gone wrong:</b> <a href="#footnote4">[4]</a><a href="#footnote5">[5]</a><a href="#footnote6">[6]</a><a href="#footnote7">[7]</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  	<b>Computer error may have led to incorrect prescribing of statins to thousands of patients.</b>
  	<ul>
  		<li>
  			Thousands of patients in England may have been incorrectly prescribed or taken off statins because of a major
IT glitch.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Underlying cause: (1) code mapping errors, and (2) brittle means for determining equivalence.
  		</li>
  	</ul>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<b>Alert for monitoring thyroid function when taking Amiodarone stopped working.</b>
  	<ul>
  		<li>
  			Amiodarone is associated with several side effects, including thyroid dysfunction, which is due to amiodarone's
high iodine content and its direct toxic effect on the thyroid.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Underlying cause: (1) the identifier for the drug amiodarone was changed in another system, and (2) uncoordinated
means for determining equivalence.
  		</li>
  	</ul>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<b>62 percent of clinical decision support (CDS) malfunctions were attributable to changes in underlying codes
or data fields.</b>
  	<ul>
  		<li>
  			Change is a constant feature of providing healthcare.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Underlying cause: (1) poorly managed change.
  		</li>
  	</ul>	
  	</li>
  </ul>
