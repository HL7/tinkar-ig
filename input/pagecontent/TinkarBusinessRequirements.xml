            these operations should be as unobtrusive as possible to patients and care providers,
            and always readily available.</p><p>These operations depend on the availability not only of currently accurate terminology
            assets, but also <span class="underline"><a class="emphasis" href="#requirement_7">assets from prior

            of knowledge happens at different times and places. Keeping standards and relationships
            to standards current is a complex undertaking. A health system may subscribe to dozens
            of standard and commercial terminologies, each of which may publish scheduled updates
            several times a year, and any of which may push out an emergency update at any time. All
            these assets have different designs, so ensuring continued cohesion is expensive and
            time-consuming, and the necessary transformations introduce risk. Systematic management
            of change requires granular representation of the assets and associated asset
            changes.</p><p>There are best-practice capabilities in knowledge asset maintenance. The following is
            proposed for clinical data standards:</p><p>

                        persisted as the object changes over time, along with metadata indicating
                        its version identifier, time of creation, creating author, and branch of the
                        version control system on which it was created. Further, every version of

                        between them. Among other things, this capability is important to determine
                        whether updates to a sub-artifact have changed its semantics in a way that
                        may affect the behavior of one or more of its parent artifacts. Ready
                        comparison is also important when merging two or more concurrent development

                        to objects in this branch do not appear in the original configuration. This
                        capability allows individual knowledge engineers to make and test changes to
                        knowledge artifacts without affecting the work of other knowledge engineers
                        or the integrity of knowledge artifacts currently in production. This
                        facility is critical to the orderly and safe management of a clinical

                        between different versions of the same objects are detected and resolved.
                        This capability is important to enable work done by multiple knowledge
                        engineers concurrently to be combined and incorporated into the main branch
                        of the repository. The merging capability is also important to allow
                        knowledge engineers to update their local branches of the repository with
                        changes that may have been made by others to the main branch, thus ensuring
                        that changes will remain compatible with the latest version of the

            existing asset, must have a STAMP to determine when it is to be used. The STAMP
            properties support the ability to apply terminology assets for specific purposes. For
            example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>&#8220;Path&#8221; can be used to test provisional content without physically swapping out
                    systems. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>&#8220;Modules&#8221; are used to organize content for maintenance and publication
                    purposes. Modules are the domain or organizational name of the larger asset
                    within which the component is meaningful, such as code system or edition.
                    Modularity for terminologies should follow a similar design to modularity in
                    software engineering. Deciding what belongs in certain modules or extensions
                    within certain terminologies is a difficult subject that is out of scope for
                    this document, but having support for the ability to create modules, recognize
                    redundancy, and merge or retire concepts are important requirements that must be
                    supported. [12-14] </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>&#8220;Time&#8221; supports the ability to apply CDS rules as they would have looked in
                    the past.</p></li></ul></div><p>A further requirement is that not only must the architecture support these properties,
            but that <span class="underline">it must require</span> the properties for all
            assets under curation. Without consistent application of this rule, the foundational
            capability of detailed version management is more difficult. </p><p>Additionally, for an asset to support a record of changes, each <span class="underline"><a class="emphasis" href="#requirement_10">asset must itself be identifiable
                (Requirement 10)</a></span>.</p><p>The &#8220;single syntax&#8221; requirement is harder to satisfy. One approach would be to define
            a syntax that addresses the data elements of all known terminologies. This would be a
            heavy specification, that would be difficult to maintain, and could fail to capture new
            elements as terminologies are added in the future.</p><p>The other approach is to use a &#8220;self-describing&#8221; or &#8220;meta-modeling&#8221; approach, where
            the syntax defines not only the content but also what the content means. &#8220;Rigid&#8221; or
            &#8220;brittle&#8221; specifications determine in advance where information belongs: a database may
            use column names to suggest what belongs in a column, but there is no way to determine
            whether the name is a good one, or whether an instance value meets the criterion implied
            by the name. But flexible specifications support data definition. Extensible Markup
            Language (XML) (a subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language [SGML]) provides a way
            to specify types of data and structural (not semantic) relationships. Resource
            Description Framework (RDF) goes one step further by making the relationship between an
            element and its containing class an explicit part of every triplet. If this relationship
            is specified in a controlled terminology, then assertions can be tested for validity.
            For example, if an RDF Schema Specification (RDFS) asserts that the finding site of a
            lesion must be an anatomical feature, then assertions about actual lesions can be tested
            for valid finding sites. Furthermore, this logic specifies a &#8220;range&#8221; in the same
            syntactic structure as the instance assertion: changes to the knowledge base do not
            affect the syntactical representation of the knowledge. Systems that adopt this approach
            will require effort to take advantage of new features of terminologies, without having
            to rebuild their infrastructure when changes are made.</p><p>Having change data in discrete tagged change sets will allow the software to hide most
            of the complexity of version management from the human managers, allowing them to focus

                constraints could be used to ensure that the terminologies represented within a

                    perform Quality Assurance on content that is represented within a Tinkar
                    implementation. For example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" start="7" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>SNOMED CT ® Fully Specified Name hierarchy tags are applied based

                an Allow List could also be represented as a Semantic to record concepts that are
                allowed to not conform to a constraint. Constraints would be represented using
                semantics as they are self describing and can support multiple different
                representations for constraints (SNOMED CT ® Expression Constraint Language, Drools,
                etc.). Representing Constraints as a Semantic also ensures STAMP. STAMP is versioned
                over time, capturing author information and allowing for tests and progress over
                different modules and paths.</p><p>Implementing Constraints would depend upon how the Constraints are written
                and formatted. For example, implementers could utilize a Rete algorithm through
